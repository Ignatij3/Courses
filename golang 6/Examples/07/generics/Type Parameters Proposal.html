This design has been <a href="https://golang.org/issue/43651">proposed and accepted</a> as a future language change. We currently expect that this change will be available in the Go 1.18 release in early 2022.</p><h2><a class="h" name="Abstract" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Abstract"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="abstract" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#abstract"><span></span></a>Abstract</h2><p>We suggest extending the Go language to add optional type parameters to type and function declarations. Type parameters are constrained by interface types. Interface types, when used as type constraints, support embedding additional elements that may be used to limit the set of types that satisfy the constraint. Parameterized types and functions may use operators with type parameters, but only when permitted by all types that satisfy the parameter's constraint. Type inference via a unification algorithm permits omitting type arguments from function calls in many cases. The design is fully backward compatible with Go 1.</p><h2><a class="h" name="How-to-read-this-proposal" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#How-to-read-this-proposal"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="how-to-read-this-proposal" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#how-to-read-this-proposal"><span></span></a>How to read this proposal</h2><p>This document is long.

There has been extensive discussion on <a href="https://golang.org/issue/15292">the issue tracker</a> and on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vrAy9gMpMoS3uaVphB32uVXX4pi-HnNjkMEgyAHX4N4/view">a living document</a>.</p><p>This design suggests extending the Go language to add a form of parametric polymorphism, where the type parameters are bounded not by a declared subtyping relationship (as in some object oriented languages) but by explicitly defined structural constraints.</p><p>This version of the design has many similarities to a design draft presented on July 31, 2019, but contracts have been removed and replaced by interface types, and the syntax has changed.</p><p>There have been several proposals for adding type parameters, which can be found through the links above. Many of the ideas presented here have appeared before. The main new features described here are the syntax and the careful examination of interface types as constraints.</p><p>This design does not support template metaprogramming or any other form of compile time programming.</p><p>As the term <em>generic</em> is widely used in the Go community, we will use it below as a shorthand to mean a function or type that takes type parameters. Don't confuse the term generic as used in this design with the same term in other languages like C++, C#, Java, or Rust; they have similarities but are not the same.</p><h2><a class="h" name="Design" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Design"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="design" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#design"><span></span></a>Design</h2><p>We will describe the complete design in stages based on simple examples.</p><h3><a class="h" name="Type-parameters" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Type-parameters"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="type-parameters" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#type-parameters"><span></span></a>Type parameters</h3><p>Generic code is written using abstract data types that we call <em>type parameters</em>. When running the generic code, the type parameters are replaced by <em>type arguments</em>.</p><p>Here is a function that prints out each element of a slice, where the element type of the slice, here called <code class="code">T</code>, is unknown. This is a trivial example of the kind of function we want to permit in order to support generic programming. (Later we'll also discuss <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Generic-types">generic types</a>).</p><pre class="code">// Print prints the elements of a slice.
// It should be possible to call this with any slice value.
func Print(s []T) { // Just an example, not the suggested syntax.
	for _, v := range s {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}
}
</pre><p>With this approach, the first decision to make is: how should the type parameter <code class="code">T</code> be declared? In a language like Go, we expect every identifier to be declared in some way.</p><p>Here we make a design decision: type parameters are similar to ordinary non-type function parameters, and as such should be listed along with other parameters. However, type parameters are not the same as non-type parameters, so although they appear in the list of parameters we want to distinguish them. That leads to our next design decision: we define an additional optional parameter list describing type parameters.</p><p>This type parameter list appears before the regular parameters. To distinguish the type parameter list from the regular parameter list, the type parameter list uses square brackets rather than parentheses. Just as regular parameters have types, type parameters have meta-types, also known as constraints. We will discuss the details of constraints later; for now, we will just note that <code class="code">any</code> is a valid constraint, meaning that any type is permitted.</p><pre class="code">// Print prints the elements of any slice.
// Print has a type parameter T and has a single (non-type)
// parameter s which is a slice of that type parameter.
func Print[T any](s []T) {
	// same as above
}
</pre><p>This says that within the function <code class="code">Print</code> the identifier <code class="code">T</code> is a type parameter, a type that is currently unknown but that will be known when the function is called. The <code class="code">any</code> means that <code class="code">T</code> can be any type at all. As seen above, the type parameter may be used as a type when describing the types of the ordinary non-type parameters. It may also be used as a type within the body of the function.</p><p>Unlike regular parameter lists, in type parameter lists names are required for the type parameters. This avoids a syntactic ambiguity, and, as it happens, there is no reason to ever omit the type parameter names.</p><p>Since <code class="code">Print</code> has a type parameter, any call of <code class="code">Print</code> must provide a type argument. Later we will see how this type argument can usually be deduced from the non-type argument, by using <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Type-inference">type inference</a>. For now, we'll pass the type argument explicitly. Type arguments are passed much like type parameters are declared: as a separate list of arguments. As with the type parameter list, the list of type arguments uses square brackets.</p><pre class="code">	// Call Print with a []int.
	// Print has a type parameter T, and we want to pass a []int,
	// so we pass a type argument of int by writing Print[int].
	// The function Print[int] expects a []int as an argument.
	Print[int]([]int{1, 2, 3})

	// This will print:
	// 1
	// 2
	// 3

Let’s turn it into a function that converts a slice of any type into a <code class="code">[]string</code> by calling a <code class="code">String</code> method on each element.</p><pre class="code">// This function is INVALID.
func Stringify[T any](s []T) (ret []string) {
	for _, v := range s {
		ret = append(ret, v.String()) // INVALID
	}
	return ret
}
</pre><p>This might seem OK at first glance, but in this example <code class="code">v</code> has type <code class="code">T</code>, and <code class="code">T</code> can be any type. This means that <code class="code">T</code> need not have a <code class="code">String</code> method. So the call to <code class="code">v.String()</code> is invalid.</p><p>Naturally, the same issue arises in other languages that support generic programming. In C++, for example, a generic function (in C++ terms, a function template) can call any method on a value of generic type. That is, in the C++ approach, calling <code class="code">v.String()</code> is fine. If the function is called with a type argument that does not have a <code class="code">String</code> method, the error is reported when compiling the call to <code class="code">v.String</code> with that type argument. These errors can be lengthy, as there may be several layers of generic function calls before the error occurs, all of which must be reported to understand what went wrong.</p><p>The C++ approach would be a poor choice for Go. One reason is the style of the language. In Go we don't refer to names, such as, in this case, <code class="code">String</code>, and hope that they exist. Go resolves all names to their declarations when they are seen.</p><p>Another reason is that Go is designed to support programming at scale. We must consider the case in which the generic function definition (<code class="code">Stringify</code>, above) and the call to the generic function (not shown, but perhaps in some other package) are far apart. In general, all generic code expects the type arguments to meet certain requirements. We refer to these requirements as <em>constraints</em> (other languages have similar ideas known as type bounds or trait bounds or concepts). In this case, the constraint is pretty obvious: the type has to have a <code class="code">String() string</code> method. In other cases it may be much less obvious.</p><p>We don‘t want to derive the constraints from whatever <code class="code">Stringify</code> happens to do (in this case, call the <code class="code">String</code> method). If we did, a minor change to <code class="code">Stringify</code> might change the constraints. That would mean that a minor change could cause code far away, that calls the function, to unexpectedly break. It’s fine for <code class="code">Stringify</code> to deliberately change its constraints, and force callers to change. What we want to avoid is <code class="code">Stringify</code> changing its constraints accidentally.</p><p>This means that the constraints must set limits on both the type arguments passed by the caller and the code in the generic function. The caller may only pass type arguments that satisfy the constraints. The generic function may only use those values in ways that are permitted by the constraints. This is an important rule that we believe should apply to any attempt to define generic programming in Go: generic code can only use operations that its type arguments are known to implement.</p><h3><a class="h" name="Operations-permitted-for-any-type" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Operations-permitted-for-any-type"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="operations-permitted-for-any-type" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#operations-permitted-for-any-type"><span></span></a>Operations permitted for any type</h3><p>Before we discuss constraints further, let's briefly note what happens when the constraint is <code class="code">any</code>. If a generic function uses the <code class="code">any</code> constraint for a type parameter, as is the case for the <code class="code">Print</code> method above, then any type argument is permitted for that parameter. The only operations that the generic function can use with values of that type parameter are those operations that are permitted for values of any type. In the example above, the <code class="code">Print</code> function declares a variable <code class="code">v</code> whose type is the type parameter <code class="code">T</code>, and it passes that variable to a function.</p><p>The operations permitted for any type are:</p><ul><li>declare variables of those types</li><li>assign other values of the same type to those variables</li><li>pass those variables to functions or return them from functions</li><li>take the address of those variables</li><li>convert or assign values of those types to the type <code class="code">interface{}</code></li><li>convert a value of type <code class="code">T</code> to type <code class="code">T</code> (permitted but useless)</li><li>use a type assertion to convert an interface value to the type</li><li>use the type as a case in a type switch</li><li>define and use composite types that use those types, such as a slice of that type</li><li>pass the type to some predeclared functions such as <code class="code">new</code></li></ul><p>It's possible that future language changes will add other such operations, though none are currently anticipated.</p><h3><a class="h" name="Defining-constraints" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Defining-constraints"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="defining-constraints" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#defining-constraints"><span></span></a>Defining constraints</h3><p>Go already has a construct that is close to what we need for a constraint: an interface type. An interface type is a set of methods. The only values that can be assigned to a variable of interface type are those whose types implement the same methods. The only operations that can be done with a value of interface type, other than operations permitted for any type, are to call the methods.</p><p>Calling a generic function with a type argument is similar to assigning to a variable of interface type: the type argument must implement the constraints of the type parameter. Writing a generic function is like using values of interface type: the generic code can only use the operations permitted by the constraint (or operations that are permitted for any type).</p><p>Therefore, in this design, constraints are simply interface types. Satisfying a constraint means implementing the interface type. (Later we'll restate this in order to define constraints for operations other than method calls, such as <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Operators">binary operators</a>).</p><p>For the <code class="code">Stringify</code> example, we need an interface type with a <code class="code">String</code> method that takes no arguments and returns a value of type <code class="code">string</code>.</p><pre class="code">// Stringer is a type constraint that requires the type argument to have
// a String method and permits the generic function to call String.
// The String method should return a string representation of the value.
type Stringer interface {
	String() string
}
</pre><p>(It doesn‘t matter for this discussion, but this defines the same interface as the standard library’s <code class="code">fmt.Stringer</code> type, and  real code would likely simply use <code class="code">fmt.Stringer</code>.)</p><h3><a class="h" name="The-constraint" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#The-constraint"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="the-constraint" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#the-constraint"><span></span></a>The <code class="code">any</code> constraint</h3><p>Now that we know that constraints are simply interface types, we can explain what <code class="code">any</code> means as a constraint. As shown above, the <code class="code">any</code> constraint permits any type as a type argument and only permits the function to use the operations permitted for any type. The interface type for that is the empty interface: <code class="code">interface{}</code>. So we could write the <code class="code">Print</code> example as</p><pre class="code">// Print prints the elements of any slice.
// Print has a type parameter T and has a single (non-type)
// parameter s which is a slice of that type parameter.
func Print[T interface{}](s []T) {
	// same as above
}
</pre><p>However, it‘s tedious to have to write <code class="code">interface{}</code> every time you write a generic function that doesn’t impose constraints on its type parameters. So in this design we suggest a type constraint <code class="code">any</code> that is equivalent to <code class="code">interface{}</code>. This will be a predeclared name, implicitly declared in the universe block. It will not be valid to use <code class="code">any</code> as anything other than a type constraint.</p><p>(Note: clearly we could make <code class="code">any</code> generally available as an alias for <code class="code">interface{}</code>, or as a new defined type defined as <code class="code">interface{}</code>. However, we don't want this design, which is about generics, to lead to a possibly significant change to non-generic code.

Interface types provide a set of methods, and nothing else. This means that with what we’ve seen so far, the only thing that generic functions can do with values of type parameters, other than operations that are permitted for any type, is call methods.</p><p>However, method calls are not sufficient for everything we want to express.

</pre><p>Any reasonable generics implementation should let you write this function. The problem is the expression <code class="code">v &lt; r</code>. This assumes that <code class="code">T</code> supports the <code class="code">&lt;</code> operator, but the constraint on <code class="code">T</code> is simply <code class="code">any</code>. With the <code class="code">any</code> constraint the function <code class="code">Smallest</code> can only use operations that are available for all types, but not all Go types support <code class="code">&lt;</code>. Unfortunately, since <code class="code">&lt;</code> is not a method, there is no obvious way to write a constraint—an interface type—that permits <code class="code">&lt;</code>.</p><p>We need a way to write a constraint that accepts only types that support <code class="code">&lt;</code>. In order to do that, we observe that, aside from two exceptions that we will discuss later, all the arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators defined by the language may only be used with types that are predeclared by the language, or with defined types whose underlying type is one of those predeclared types. That is, the operator <code class="code">&lt;</code> can only be used with a predeclared type such as <code class="code">int</code> or <code class="code">float64</code>, or a defined type whose underlying type is one of those types. Go does not permit using <code class="code">&lt;</code> with a composite type or with an arbitrary defined type.</p><p>This means that rather than try to write a constraint for <code class="code">&lt;</code>, we can approach this the other way around: instead of saying which operators a constraint should support, we can say which types a constraint should accept. We do this by defining a <em>type set</em> for a constraint.</p><h4><a class="h" name="Type-sets" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Type-sets"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="type-sets" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#type-sets"><span></span></a>Type sets</h4><p>Although we are primarily interested in defining the type set of constraints, the most straightforward approach is to define the type set of all types. The type set of a constraint is then constructed out of the type sets of its elements. This may seem like a digression from the topic of using operators with parameterized types, but we'll get there in the end.</p><p>Every type has an associated type set. The type set of a non-interface type <code class="code">T</code> is simply the set <code class="code">{T}</code>: a set that contains just <code class="code">T</code> itself. The type set of an ordinary interface type is the set of all types that declare all the methods of the interface.</p><p>Note that the type set of an ordinary interface type is an infinite set. For any given type <code class="code">T</code> and interface type <code class="code">IT</code> it's easy to tell whether <code class="code">T</code> is in the type set of <code class="code">IT</code> (by checking if all methods of <code class="code">IT</code> are declared by <code class="code">T</code>), but there is no reasonable way to enumerate all the types in the type set of <code class="code">IT</code>. The type <code class="code">IT</code> is a member of its own type set, because an interface inherently declares all of its own methods. The type set of the empty interface <code class="code">interface{}</code> is the set of all possible types.</p><p>It will be useful to construct the type set of an interface type by looking at the elements of the interface. This will produce the same result in a different way. The elements of an interface can be either a method signature or an embedded interface type. Although a method signature is not a type, it's convenient to define a type set for it: the set of all types that declare that method. The type set of an embedded interface type <code class="code">E</code> is simply that of <code class="code">E</code>: the set of all types that declare all the methods of <code class="code">E</code>.</p><p>For any method signature <code class="code">M</code>, the type set of <code class="code">interface{ M }</code> is the type of <code class="code">M</code>: the set of all types that declare <code class="code">M</code>. For any method signatures <code class="code">M1</code> and <code class="code">M2</code>, the type set of <code class="code">interface{ M1; M2 }</code> is set of all types that declare both <code class="code">M1</code> and <code class="code">M2</code>. This is the intersection of the type set of <code class="code">M1</code> and the type set of <code class="code">M2</code>. To see this, observe that the type set of <code class="code">M1</code> is the set of all types with a method <code class="code">M1</code>, and similarly for <code class="code">M2</code>. If we take the intersection of those two type sets, the result is the set of all types that declare both <code class="code">M1</code> and <code class="code">M2</code>. That is exactly the type set of <code class="code">interface{ M1; M2 }</code>.</p><p>The same applies to embedded interface types. For any two interface types <code class="code">E1</code> and <code class="code">E2</code>, the type set of <code class="code">interface{ E1; E2 }</code> is the intersection of the type sets of <code class="code">E1</code> and <code class="code">E2</code>.</p><p>Therefore, the type set of an interface type is the intersection of the type sets of the element of the interface.</p><h4><a class="h" name="Type-sets-of-constraints" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Type-sets-of-constraints"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="type-sets-of-constraints" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#type-sets-of-constraints"><span></span></a>Type sets of constraints</h4><p>Now that we have described the type set of an interface type, we will redefine what it means to satisfy the constraint.

Now we will say that a type argument satisfies a constraint if it is a member of the constraint's type set.</p><p>For an ordinary interface type, one whose only elements are method signatures and embedded ordinary interface types, the meaning is exactly the same: the set of types that implement the interface type is exactly the set of types that are in its type set.</p><p>We will now proceed to define additional elements that may appear in an interface type that is used as a constraint, and define how those additional elements can be used to further control the type set of the constraint.</p><h4><a class="h" name="Constraint-elements" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Constraint-elements"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="constraint-elements" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#constraint-elements"><span></span></a>Constraint elements</h4><p>The elements of an ordinary interface type are method signatures and embedded interface types.

We also permit specifying just some of the type arguments, or omitting the type arguments entirely, when the missing type arguments can be inferred. When only some type arguments are passed, they are the arguments for the first type parameters in the list.</p><p>For example, a function like this:</p><pre class="code">func Map[F, T any](s []F, f func(F) T) []T { ... }
</pre><p>can be called in these ways.  (We'll explain below how type inference works in detail; this example is to show how an incomplete list of type arguments is handled.)</p><pre class="code">	var s []int
	f := func(i int) int64 { return int64(i) }

	r = Map[int, int64](s, f)
	// Specify just the first type argument, for F,
	// and let T be inferred.
	r = Map[int](s, f)
	// Don't specify any type arguments, and let both be inferred.
	r = Map(s, f)
</pre><p>If a generic function or type is used without specifying all the type arguments, it is an error if any of the unspecified type arguments cannot be inferred.</p><p>(Note: type inference is a convenience feature. Although we think it is an important feature, it does not add any functionality to the design, only convenience in using it. It would be possible to omit it from the initial implementation, and see whether it seems to be needed. That said, this feature doesn't require additional syntax, and produces more readable code.)</p><h4><a class="h" name="Type-unification" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Type-unification"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="type-unification" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#type-unification"><span></span></a>Type unification</h4><p>Type inference is based on <em>type unification</em>. Type unification applies to two types, either or both of which may be or contain type parameters.</p><p>Type unification works by comparing the structure of the types. Their structure disregarding type parameters must be identical, and types other than type parameters must be equivalent. A type parameter in one type may match any complete subtype in the other type. If the structure differs, or types other than type parameters are not equivalent, then type unification fails. A successful type unification provides a list of associations of type parameters with other types (which may themselves be or contain type parameters).</p><p>For type unification, two types that don‘t contain any type parameters are equivalent if they are <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_identity">identical</a>, or if they are channel types that are identical ignoring channel direction, or if their underlying types are equivalent. It’s OK to permit types to not be identical during type inference, because we will still check the constraints if inference succeeds, and we will still check that the function arguments are assignable to the inferred types.</p><p>For example, if <code class="code">T1</code> and <code class="code">T2</code> are type parameters, <code class="code">[]map[int]bool</code> can be unified with any of the following:</p><ul><li><code class="code">[]map[int]bool</code></li><li><code class="code">T1</code> (<code class="code">T1</code> matches <code class="code">[]map[int]bool</code>)</li><li><code class="code">[]T1</code> (<code class="code">T1</code> matches <code class="code">map[int]bool</code>)</li><li><code class="code">[]map[T1]T2</code> (<code class="code">T1</code> matches <code class="code">int</code>, <code class="code">T2</code> matches <code class="code">bool</code>)</li></ul><p>(This is not an exclusive list, there are other possible successful unifications.)</p><p>On the other hand, <code class="code">[]map[int]bool</code> cannot be unified with any of</p><ul><li><code class="code">int</code></li><li><code class="code">struct{}</code></li><li><code class="code">[]struct{}</code></li><li><code class="code">[]map[T1]string</code></li></ul><p>(This list is of course also not exclusive; there are an infinite number of types that cannot be successfully unified.)</p><p>In general we can also have type parameters on both sides, so in some cases we might associate <code class="code">T1</code> with, for example, <code class="code">T2</code>, or <code class="code">[]T2</code>.</p><h4><a class="h" name="Function-argument-type-inference" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Function-argument-type-inference"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="function-argument-type-inference" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#function-argument-type-inference"><span></span></a>Function argument type inference</h4><p>Function argument type inference is used with a function call to infer type arguments from non-type arguments. Function argument type inference is not used when a type is instantiated, and it is not used when a function is instantiated but not called.</p><p>To see how it works, let's go back to <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Type-parameters">the example</a> of a call to the simple <code class="code">Print</code> function:</p><pre class="code">	Print[int]([]int{1, 2, 3})
</pre><p>The type argument <code class="code">int</code> in this function call can be inferred from the type of the non-type argument.</p><p>The only type arguments that can be inferred are those that are used for the types of the function‘s (non-type) input parameters. If there are some type parameters that are used only for the function’s result parameter types, or only in the body of the function, then those type arguments cannot be inferred using function argument type inference.</p><p>To infer function type arguments, we unify the types of the function call arguments with the types of the function‘s non-type parameters. On the caller side we have the list of types of the actual (non-type) arguments, which for the <code class="code">Print</code> example is simply <code class="code">[]int</code>. On the function side is the list of the types of the function’s non-type parameters, which for <code class="code">Print</code> is <code class="code">[]T</code>. In the lists, we discard respective arguments for which the function side does not use a type parameter. We must then apply type unification to the remaining argument types.</p><p>Function argument type inference is a two-pass algorithm. In the first pass, we ignore untyped constants on the caller side and their corresponding types in the function definition. We use two passes so that in some cases later arguments can determine the type of an untyped constant.</p><p>We unify corresponding types in the lists. This will give us an association of type parameters on the function side to types on the caller side. If the same type parameter appears more than once on the function side, it will match multiple argument types on the caller side. If those caller types are not equivalent, we report an error.</p><p>After the first pass, we check any untyped constants on the caller side. If there are no untyped constants, or if the type parameters in the corresponding function types have matched other input types, then type unification is complete.</p><p>Otherwise, for the second pass, for any untyped constants whose corresponding function types are not yet set, we determine the default type of the untyped constant in <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Constants">the usual way</a>. Then we unify the remaining types again, this time with no untyped constants.</p><p>When constraint type inference is possible, as described below, it is applied between the two passes.</p><p>In this example</p><pre class="code">	s1 := []int{1, 2, 3}
	Print(s1)
</pre><p>we compare <code class="code">[]int</code> with <code class="code">[]T</code>, match <code class="code">T</code> with <code class="code">int</code>, and we are done. The single type parameter <code class="code">T</code> is <code class="code">int</code>, so we infer that the call to <code class="code">Print</code> is really a call to <code class="code">Print[int]</code>.</p><p>For a more complex example, consider</p><pre class="code">// Map calls the function f on every element of the slice s,
// returning a new slice of the results.
func Map[F, T any](s []F, f func(F) T) []T {
	r := make([]T, len(s))
	for i, v := range s {
		r[i] = f(v)
	}
	return r
}
</pre><p>The two type parameters <code class="code">F</code> and <code class="code">T</code> are both used for input parameters, so function argument type inference is possible. In the call</p><pre class="code">	strs := Map([]int{1, 2, 3}, strconv.Itoa)
</pre><p>we unify <code class="code">[]int</code> with <code class="code">[]F</code>, matching <code class="code">F</code> with <code class="code">int</code>. We unify the type of <code class="code">strconv.Itoa</code>, which is <code class="code">func(int) string</code>, with <code class="code">func(F) T</code>, matching <code class="code">F</code> with <code class="code">int</code> and <code class="code">T</code> with <code class="code">string</code>. The type parameter <code class="code">F</code> is matched twice, both times with <code class="code">int</code>. Unification succeeds, so the call written as <code class="code">Map</code> is a call of <code class="code">Map[int, string]</code>.</p><p>To see the untyped constant rule in effect, consider:</p><pre class="code">// NewPair returns a pair of values of the same type.
func NewPair[F any](f1, f2 F) *Pair[F] { ... }
</pre><p>In the call <code class="code">NewPair(1, 2)</code> both arguments are untyped constants, so both are ignored in the first pass. There is nothing to unify. We still have two untyped constants after the first pass. Both are set to their default type, <code class="code">int</code>. The second run of the type unification pass unifies <code class="code">F</code> with <code class="code">int</code>, so the final call is <code class="code">NewPair[int](1, 2)</code>.</p><p>In the call <code class="code">NewPair(1, int64(2))</code> the first argument is an untyped constant, so we ignore it in the first pass. We then unify <code class="code">int64</code> with <code class="code">F</code>. At this point the type parameter corresponding to the untyped constant is fully determined, so the final call is <code class="code">NewPair[int64](1, int64(2))</code>.</p><p>In the call <code class="code">NewPair(1, 2.5)</code> both arguments are untyped constants, so we move on the second pass. This time we set the first constant to <code class="code">int</code> and the second to <code class="code">float64</code>. We then try to unify <code class="code">F</code> with both <code class="code">int</code> and <code class="code">float64</code>, so unification fails, and we report a compilation error.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, function argument type inference is done without regard to constraints. First we use function argument type inference to determine type arguments to use for the function, and then, if that succeeds, we check whether those type arguments implement the constraints (if any).</p><p>Note that after successful function argument type inference, the compiler must still check that the arguments can be assigned to the parameters, as for any function call.</p><h4><a class="h" name="Constraint-type-inference" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Constraint-type-inference"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="constraint-type-inference" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#constraint-type-inference"><span></span></a>Constraint type inference</h4><p>Constraint type inference permits inferring a type argument from another type argument, based on type parameter constraints. Constraint type inference is useful when a function wants to have a type name for an element of some other type parameter, or when a function wants to apply a constraint to a type that is based on some other type parameter.</p><p>Constraint type inference can only infer types if some type parameter has a constraint that has a type set with exactly one type in it, or a type set for which the underlying type of every type in the type set is the same type. The two cases are slightly different, as in the first case, in which the type set has exactly one type, the single type need not be its own underlying type. Either way, the single type is called a <em>structural type</em>, and the constraint is called a <em>structural constraint</em>. The structural type describes the required structure of the type parameter. A structural constraint may also define methods, but the methods are ignored by constraint type inference. For constraint type inference to be useful, the structural type will normally be defined using one or more type parameters.</p><p>Constraint type inference is only tried if there is at least one type parameter whose type argument is not yet known.</p><p>While the algorithm we describe here may seem complex, for typical concrete examples it is straightforward to see what constraint type inference will deduce. The description of the algorithm is followed by a couple of examples.</p><p>We start by creating a mapping from type parameters to type arguments. We initialize the mapping with all type parameters whose type arguments are already known, if any.</p><p>For each type parameter with a structural constraint, we unify the type parameter with the structural type. This will have the effect of associating the type parameter with its constraint. We add the result into the mapping we are maintaining. If unification finds any associations of type parameters, we add those to the mapping as well. When we find multiple associations of any one type parameter, we unify each such association to produce a single mapping entry. If a type parameter is associated directly with another type parameter, meaning that they must both be matched with the same type, we unify the associations of each parameter together. If any of these various unifications fail, then constraint type inference fails.</p><p>After merging all type parameters with structural constraints, we have a mapping of various type parameters to types (which may be or contain other type parameters). We continue by looking for a type parameter <code class="code">T</code> that is mapped to a fully known type argument <code class="code">A</code>, one that does not contain any type parameters. Anywhere that <code class="code">T</code> appears in a type argument in the mapping, we replace <code class="code">T</code> with <code class="code">A</code>. We repeat this process until we have replaced every type parameter.</p><p>When constraint type inference is possible, type inference proceeds as followed:</p><ul><li>Build the mapping using known type arguments.</li><li>Apply constraint type inference.</li><li>Apply function type inference using typed arguments.</li><li>Apply constraint type inference again.</li><li>Apply function type inference using the default types of any remaining untyped arguments.</li><li>Apply constraint type inference again.</li></ul><h5><a class="h" name="Element-constraint-example" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Element-constraint-example"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="element-constraint-example" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#element-constraint-example"><span></span></a>Element constraint example</h5><p>For an example of where constraint type inference is useful, let's consider a function that takes a defined type that is a slice of numbers, and returns an instance of that same defined type in which each number is doubled.</p><p>It's easy to write a function similar to this if we ignore the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_definitions">defined type</a> requirement.</p><pre class="code">// Double returns a new slice that contains all the elements of s, doubled.

</pre><p>In order to write the <code class="code">Equaler</code> constraint, we have to write a constraint that can refer to the type argument being passed in. The easiest way to do this is to take advantage of the fact that a constraint does not have to be a defined type, it can simply be an interface type literal. This interface type literal can then refer to the type parameter.</p><pre class="code">// Index returns the index of e in s, or -1 if not found.

Clearly this design makes the language more complex.</p><p>We believe that the increased complexity is small for people reading well written generic code, rather than writing it. Naturally people must learn the new syntax for declaring type parameters. This new syntax, and the new support for type sets in interfaces, are the only new syntactic constructs in this design. The code within a generic function reads like ordinary Go code, as can be seen in the examples below. It is an easy shift to go from <code class="code">[]int</code> to <code class="code">[]T</code>. Type parameter constraints serve effectively as documentation, describing the type.</p><p>We expect that most packages will not define generic types or functions, but many packages are likely to use generic types or functions defined elsewhere. In the common case, generic functions work exactly like non-generic functions: you simply call them. Type inference means that you do not have to write out the type arguments explicitly. The type inference rules are designed to be unsurprising: either the type arguments are deduced correctly, or the call fails and requires explicit type parameters.

There is no way to write multiple versions of a generic function that are designed to work with specific type arguments.</li><li>No metaprogramming. There is no way to write code that is executed at compile time to generate code to be executed at run time.</li><li>No higher level abstraction. There is no way to use a function with type arguments other than to call it or instantiate it. There is no way to use a generic type other than to instantiate it.</li><li>No general type description. In order to use operators in a generic function, constraints list specific types, rather than describing the characteristics that a type must have. This is easy to understand but may be limiting at times.</li><li>No covariance or contravariance of function parameters.</li><li>No operator methods. You can write a generic container that is compile-time type-safe, but you can only access it with ordinary methods, not with syntax like <code class="code">c[k]</code>.</li><li>No currying. There is no way to partially instantiate a generic function or type, other than by using a helper function or a wrapper type. All type arguments must be either explicitly passed or inferred at instantiation time.</li><li>No variadic type parameters. There is no support for variadic type parameters, which would permit writing a single generic function that takes different numbers of both type parameters and regular parameters.</li><li>No adaptors. There is no way for a constraint to define adaptors that could be used to support type arguments that do not already implement the constraint, such as, for example, defining an <code class="code">==</code> operator in terms of an <code class="code">Equal</code> method, or vice-versa.</li><li>No parameterization on non-type values such as constants. This arises most obviously for arrays, where it might sometimes be convenient to write <code class="code">type Matrix[n int] [n][n]float64</code>.

So in general instantiating parameterized methods in the linker might require instantiating every parameterized method for every possible type argument, which seems untenable.</p><p>Or, we could instantiate it at run time. In general this means using some sort of JIT, or compiling the code to use some sort of reflection based approach.

For <code class="code">[]T(v1)</code> and <code class="code">[]T(v2){}</code>, at the point of the open parentheses we don‘t know whether this is a type conversion (of the value <code class="code">v1</code> to the type <code class="code">[]T</code>) or a type literal (whose type is the instantiated type <code class="code">T(v2)</code>). For <code class="code">interface { M(T) }</code> we don’t know whether this an interface with a method <code class="code">M</code> or an interface with an embedded instantiated interface <code class="code">M(T)</code>. These ambiguities are solvable, by adding more parentheses, but awkward.</p><p>Also some people were troubled by the number of parenthesized lists involved in declarations like <code class="code">func F(T any)(v T)(r1, r2 T)</code> or in calls like <code class="code">F(int)(1)</code>.</p><h5><a class="h" name="Why-not-use" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Why-not-use"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="why-not-use" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#why-not-use"><span></span></a>Why not use <code class="code">F«T»</code>?</h5><p>We considered it but we couldn't bring ourselves to require non-ASCII.</p><h5><a class="h" name="Why-not-define-constraints-in-a-builtin-package" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Why-not-define-constraints-in-a-builtin-package"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="why-not-define-constraints-in-a-builtin-package" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#why-not-define-constraints-in-a-builtin-package"><span></span></a>Why not define constraints in a builtin package?</h5><p><em>Instead of writing out type sets, use names like</em> <em><code class="code">constraints.Arithmetic</code> and <code class="code">constraints.Comparable</code>.</em></p><p>Listing all the possible combinations of types gets rather lengthy.

In this design we introduce only two new predeclared names, <code class="code">comparable</code> and <code class="code">any</code>.</p><p>We expect that if people find such names useful, we can introduce a package <code class="code">constraints</code> that defines those names in the form of constraints that can be used by other types and functions and embedded in other constraints.

We removed this facility because it is always possible to convert a value of any type to the empty interface type, and then use a type assertion or type switch on that. Also, it was sometimes confusing that in a constraint with a type set that uses approximation elements, a type assertion or type switch would use the actual type argument, not the underlying type of the type argument (the difference is explained in the section on <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Identifying-the-matched-predeclared-type">identifying the matched predeclared type</a>).</p><h4><a class="h" name="Comparison-with-Java" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Comparison-with-Java"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="comparison-with-java" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#comparison-with-java"><span></span></a>Comparison with Java</h4><p>Most complaints about Java generics center around type erasure. This design does not have type erasure. The reflection information for a generic type will include the full compile-time type information.</p><p>In Java type wildcards (<code class="code">List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code>, <code class="code">List&lt;? super Number&gt;</code>) implement covariance and contravariance. These concepts are missing from Go, which makes generic types much simpler.</p><h4><a class="h" name="Comparison-with-C" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Comparison-with-C"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="comparison-with-c" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#comparison-with-c"><span></span></a>Comparison with C++</h4><p>C++ templates do not enforce any constraints on the type arguments (unless the concept proposal is adopted). This means that changing template code can accidentally break far-off instantiations. It also means that error messages are reported only at instantiation time, and can be deeply nested and difficult to understand. This design avoids these problems through mandatory and explicit constraints.</p><p>C++ supports template metaprogramming, which can be thought of as ordinary programming done at compile time using a syntax that is completely different than that of non-template C++. This design has no similar feature. This saves considerable complexity while losing some power and run time efficiency.</p><p>C++ uses two-phase name lookup, in which some names are looked up in the context of the template definition, and some names are looked up in the context of the template instantiation. In this design all names are looked up at the point where they are written.</p><p>In practice, all C++ compilers compile each template at the point where it is instantiated. This can slow down compilation time. This design offers flexibility as to how to handle the compilation of generic functions.</p><h4><a class="h" name="Comparison-with-Rust" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Comparison-with-Rust"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="comparison-with-rust" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#comparison-with-rust"><span></span></a>Comparison with Rust</h4><p>The generics described in this design are similar to generics in Rust.</p><p>One difference is that in Rust the association between a trait bound and a type must be defined explicitly, either in the crate that defines the trait bound or the crate that defines the type. In Go terms, this would mean that we would have to declare somewhere whether a type satisfied a constraint. Just as Go types can satisfy Go interfaces without an explicit declaration, in this design Go type arguments can satisfy a constraint without an explicit declaration.</p><p>Where this design uses type sets, the Rust standard library defines standard traits for operations like comparison. These standard traits are automatically implemented by Rust's primitive types, and can be implemented by user defined types as well. Rust provides a fairly extensive list of traits, at least 34, covering all of the operators.</p><p>Rust supports type parameters on methods, which this design does not.</p><h2><a class="h" name="Examples" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Examples"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="examples" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#examples"><span></span></a>Examples</h2><p>The following sections are examples of how this design could be used.

func Add(s, t []byte) []byte
</pre><p><code class="code">Add</code> appended two <code class="code">[]byte</code> values together, returning a new slice. That was fine for <code class="code">[]byte</code>, but if you had a slice of some other type, you had to write essentially the same code to append more values. If this design were available back then, perhaps we would not have added <code class="code">append</code> to the language. Instead, we could write something like this:</p><pre class="code">// Package slices implements various slice algorithms.
package slices

// Append appends the contents of t to the end of s and returns the result.
// If s has enough capacity, it is extended in place; otherwise a

		panic("Append: cap out of range")
	}
	if tot &gt; cap(s) {
		news := make([]T, tot, tot + tot/2)
		copy(news, s)
		s = news
	}
	s = s[:tot]
	copy(s[lens:], t)
	return s
}
</pre><p>That example uses the predeclared <code class="code">copy</code> function, but that's OK, we can write that one too:</p><pre class="code">// Copy copies values from t to s, stopping when either slice is
// full, returning the number of values copied.
func Copy[T any](s, t []T) int {
	i := 0

		s[i] = t[i]
	}
	return i
}
</pre><p>These functions can be used as one would expect:</p><pre class="code">	s := slices.Append([]int{1, 2, 3}, 4, 5, 6)
	// Now s is []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

</pre><p>This code doesn‘t implement the special case of appending or copying a <code class="code">string</code> to a <code class="code">[]byte</code>, and it’s unlikely to be as efficient as the implementation of the predeclared function. Still, this example shows that using this design would permit <code class="code">append</code> and <code class="code">copy</code> to be written generically, once, without requiring any additional special language features.</p><h3><a class="h" name="Metrics" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#Metrics"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="metrics" href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#metrics"><span></span></a>Metrics</h3><p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/@sameer_74231/go-experience-report-for-generics-google-metrics-api-b019d597aaa4">Go experience report</a> Sameer Ajmani describes a metrics implementation. Each metric has a value and one or more fields. The fields have different types. Defining a metric requires specifying the types of the fields. The <code class="code">Add</code> method takes the field types as arguments, and records an instance of that set of fields. The C++ implementation uses a variadic template. The Java implementation includes the number of fields in the name of the type. Both the C++ and Java implementations provide compile-time type-safe Add methods.</p><p>Here is how to use this design to provide similar functionality in Go with a compile-time type-safe <code class="code">Add</code> method. Because there is no support for a variadic number of type arguments, we must use different names for a different number of arguments, as in Java. This implementation only works for comparable types.

Type inference can determine that the type argument to <code class="code">Find</code> is <code class="code">T4</code>, and from that we know that the type of the final argument must be <code class="code">func(T4, T4) bool</code>, and from that we could deduce that the type argument to <code class="code">IsClose</code> must also be <code class="code">T4</code>.
