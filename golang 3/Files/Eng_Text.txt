	Today people produce a lot of things, and as much as they make, they are throwing it out? how is this problem appeared?

	Firstly, e-waste appeared recently and now there is too much of it. I think most of people are lenny and they
are probably will decide to throw out in a simple bin, than in special, because it is hard to find them.

	But, if people sort to special bins, what they throw out, they, maybe will find some things, that nearly were thrown,
but were usable and not broken. And what about sea and landfills? They became bigger and bigger, one of them is bigger,
than Madagaskar and as big as Greenland. I think, people understand, that we need more and more resources to clean the world ocean,
but factories continue filling rivers and seas by and chemical and simple waste. Similar problem with trash on our continents
(one more problem is time decomposing) a lot of plastic, paper and chemical waste is lying on Earth, unfortunately  this waste have
very long period of decomposing. From electrical items you can do some other mechanisms, can build something for fun
(of course having some skills).

	I think, that we can not utilize all, or a half of rubbish, and anything, what we can do, will not help our planet a lot.
Our planet is very dirty and it is late, to try utilize and destroy all rubbish.
