               <P><EM class=a>Microsoft Office 2000</EM> determines the best installation for your computer based on the programs and settings that are already installed and used. If your computer has a previous version of <EM class=a>Office</EM>, <EM class=a>Office 2000</EM> uses the <EM class=a>Office Profile Wizard</EM> to preserve many of your user settings. <EM class=a>Office 2000</EM> can also remove previous versions of <EM class=a>Office</EM>.</P>
